# Time Series Forecasting

This repository is dedicated to Time Series Forecasting, a vital aspect of predictive modeling that deals with analyzing and predicting future values based on historical data indexed by time.

## Description

Time Series Forecasting involves the use of statistical models, machine learning algorithms, or deep learning techniques to predict future values of a time-dependent variable based on its past observations. This repository serves as a resource for learning, experimenting, and implementing various time series forecasting methods.

## Contents

1. **Data**: Sample datasets or links to external datasets suitable for time series forecasting tasks.
2. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks containing tutorials, examples, and demonstrations of time series forecasting techniques using different algorithms and libraries.
3. **Scripts**: Python scripts implementing time series forecasting models, including preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
4. **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on time series forecasting concepts, methodologies, and best practices.
5. **Resources**: Additional resources such as research papers, articles, and books related to time series forecasting.
